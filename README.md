Tetrix is a game made as an experiment to understand the google play platform. It is like the game Tetris. 

The player gets score when destroying a line of blocks. The more lines the player destroys at once, the more points he/she gets. The players can see each other's score at the leaderboard and choose between the swipe controlls and touchpad. It also contains simple statistics about the player's performance at the game. 

Google play achievements were also integrated but were not finalized because the game failed to bring enough profit to be continued.
